            <h3>Speed and Steering</h3>
            <p>The Mercedes-Benz AMG is built as a multi clutch, speedshift vehicle, with 9 easily available speeds and torque. The car has customizable driving modes involving the throttle, shifting, handling, and exhaust note to suit the customer's driving styles. The AMG has state of the art stability and agility thanks to the active rear-wheel steering and adjustable air-based system. The speed is primarily focused on the electromechanical mechanisms that cause the back wheels to move in the opposite direction of the front wheels, gaining more traction when driving. This change is automatic and adjusts while the car is in motion. </p>
