            <h3>Various Models</h3>

            <h3>General Design</h3>
            <p>The Mercedes-Benz AMG Coupé features a sleek, modern interior with customizable seating options for passengers that range from two to four seats and includes a console with 12.3 inch touchscreens. The Mercedes AMG is not just spacious for the passengers but also in the trunk with a cargo capacity of 351-675L. Its impressive performance is supported by the inclusion of carbon-fibre reinforced polymers, giving the car a powerful, yet lightweight feel. The vehicle is filled with a tech-forward design including three touch interfaces, voice control, electronic gear selection, customizable LED color adjustments, and interactive operating systems. </p>

            <h3>Comfortability</h3>
            <p>In terms of comfort, the Mercedes-Benz AMG has the other competitors beat. For instance, the seats contain a memory system that stores the latest positions of the driver. The seats can be custom designed to the passengers preference. However, each standard Mercedes-Benz AMG has an adjustable lumbar, shoulder supports, and a massage system that has three different levels. The car is also built in with a newly-reformed air circulation system that helps promote comfortability for all passengers all year round.There are three levels of standard heating and cooling mechanisms as it circulates through the seat towards the rear of the vehicle, creating a luxurious and inviting environment for everyone. </p>
