            <h3>Service A: </h3>
              
              <p>When becoming a Mercedes-Benz owner, there is a specific maintenance schedule that should be followed. Service A is the first step and happens at the one year mark and two years following the first visit. This service could also happen at the 20, 000 km and 40, 000 km mark, whichever is first. During this maintenance session, the team checks all the lights, the horn, any hinges to ensure they are operating to the best of their capabilities.The motor oil and filter are changed, while an inspection is completed throughout the vehicle. The inspection can include replacing the cabin dust filter, correcting the fluid levels, testing the brakes and pumping air into the tires to appropriate conditions.</p>

            <h3>Service B: </h3>
            <p>Service session B happens after Service A and includes a motor oil change, similarly to Service A but incorporates other features to ensure the car is running to its fullest capability. The Mercedes team rotates the tires of the car and replaces the filters throughout the vehicle. Along with these replacements, they also perform multiple checks such as the steering, the driveline, the suspension, any leakage, external damages, the poly belt, and the seat belts.</p>
